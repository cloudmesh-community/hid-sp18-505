Github Developer
GitHub is a software management platform that offers free and fee-based services that can be used for managing source code for software projects.  However, GitHub also offers an API through its Developer site.  The API can be used to analyze a large body of data that is stored at GitHub.  The data can be used to provide insight into trending software technologies, data sources that pertain to non-software management domains.  For example, the GitHub resource, https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Data-Sources is a reference to a variety of data sources that are open for public use \cite{GitHubDeveloper}.
