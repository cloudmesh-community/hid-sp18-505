GitHub is a software management platform that offers free and fee-based
services that can be used for managing source code for software projects.
However, GitHub also offers an API through its Developer site.  The API
can be used to analyze a large body of data that is stored at GitHub.  The
data can be used to provide insight into trending software technologies, data
sources that pertain to non-software management domains.  For example, the
\href{https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Data-Sources}{GitHub resource} 
is a reference to a variety of data sources that are open for public use 
\cite{GitHub.com2018}.
