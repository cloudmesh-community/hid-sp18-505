\section{Introduction}
This is the project proposal for Advanced Cloud Computing, Indiana University 
Spring Semester 2018.
\\
Discuss the data set\\
Discuss the justification\\
WGEW and SRER outdated\\
How can applications like WGEW and SRER leverage cloud computing --> REST and/or GraphQL to the rescue
Sending data to lambda for outlier detection using Benfords Law algo.

\section{Project Outline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build web service using GraphQL
\item Build web service using REST
\item Build load testing to test and compare both services
\item Use Amazon Lambda as part of web application to make a call to a lambda function.
\item Build a Docker Swarm or Kubernetes cluster to host the application.
\item Have the cluster auto-poll the appliction repo and update the app automagically.
\end{itemize}
