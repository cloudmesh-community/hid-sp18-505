# Cluster Project
This cluster project is being used to develop a 3-node Docker Swarm cluster.  The cluster may be re-used in the class project, time permitting.  The cluster 
built in this project is based on the work down by [Monica Gangwar](https://github.com/monicagangwar).  She created an [excellent example](https://github.com/monicagangwar/docker-swarm-vagrant) of how to use Vagrant and Docker to create a Docker swarm.  The entirety of this cluster project is based 
on her example.
