\begin{abstract}
  This project is for Advanced Cloud Computing, Indiana University
  Spring Semester 2018.  Through this project, we will demonstrate the
  use of GraphQL\cite{hid505FacebookGraphQL2018} and cloud computing
  services as a means for constructing and delivering web services.
  The project will rely on The Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER)
  website and data sets maintained by the Univeristy of Arizona and
  second, related web site, the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed
  (WGEW) Online Data Access, maintained by the United States
  Department of Agriculure's, Agriculure Research Service (ARS).
  Neither of these existing sites provide modernized data services,
  yet both sites provide potentiall valuable data to the research
  community.

\section{Introduction}
What is GraphQL?  GraphQL is a query language for web application
programer interfaces (APIs)\cite{hid505FacebookGraphQL2018}.  There
have been been many other tools and methods used to develop APIs in
the past.  Some of those older tools are XML and SOAP, JSON and REST,
plain old text or comma separated files.  What makes GraphQL so
different?  First, as the name implies, GraphQL, is a query language.
This is different compared to SOAP/XML and Swagger/REST in that those
tools are a combination of data format and transport protocol.

Typically, SOAP/XML and Swagger/REST APIs are structured so that the
API user needs to review the specifications for interacting with the
API.  For example, what functions or endpoints are available?  What
are the parameters for those functions and what data types apply to
each parameter?  GraphQL is different in that it provides a mechanism
where an API becomes a domain specific language (DSL).  This means
that API consumers can focus on developing transactions with the API
based on the data domain of the API.  For example, a GraphQL API for
stock data would allow API users to format queries something like the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
{
   all_stocks {
     symbol, price, date
}
\end{verbatim}

In this example we see a query request to a GraphQL API that is asking for all 
stock data with respective symbol, price, an date.  Alternatively, a REST 
based query might look like the following:

\begin{verbatim}
http://server.host.com/api/v1/allstocks
\end{verbatim}

In the REST based request we see information related to where the data
are being requested from, the protocol used to make the request, the
API version and finally, what the request is really after, all stock
data.  The latter could be considered more understandble to
programmers or even to someone who is technically a advanced web
users, but compared to the REST request, the GraphQL based request has
a format more closely resembling the data intself and is less concered
with how the data are requested.

A useful way to demonstrate the uses of GraphQL would be to apply
GraphQL to the development of a real-world API that will transform
existing web-based data sources created and maintained at United
Stated Deparment of Agriculture web site and the University of
Arizona.  The first data resource is the Santa Rita Experimental which
is an experimental range currently maintained by the University of
Arizona.  The experimental range was the first of its kind and was
established in 1902\cite{hid505SrerWebSite2018}.  The SRER website, in
its current state, is not structured to deliver data as a service.
The second data source is the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed,
which is also an outdoor research facility located in southestern
Arizona\cite{WgewWebSite2018}.  Like the SRER site, the WGEW
preicpitation and runoff data site is not structured to delivered as
services.

\subsection{General Outline}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Web scraping existing data source to download, parse and clean
  existing data.
\item Load the data into a database.
\item Develop a small web application to provide two web services.
  The two services will deliver the same data.  However, one of the
  services will use GraphQL\cite{hid505FacebookGraphQL2018} to deliver
  data and the other will use REST\cite{hid505swaggerio2018} to
  deliver its data.
\item Develop a simple load testing tool that will be used to
  determine performance metrics for both services and compare the
  results of the load tests.
\item Time permitting, create a simple Amazon Lambda service that will
  compute some metric related to the preciption/runoff data.  The
  purpose is to demonstrate how cloud services can be used to off-load
  costs and dependencies on a distributed system like the one proposed
  in this project.
\item Time permitting, develop a 3-node Raspberry Pi cluster to host
  the application.  The purpose of this, is to demonstrate how a
  system like this one can be hosted and deployed on hardware
  infrastructure that is cheap and relatively simple to maintain.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Collection}

Data were collected from the Santa Rita Experimental Range website.  In figure 
Figure~\ref{f:srer_landing_page}, we see the present day landing page for 
SRER.  What is not apparent in the landing page is the plethora of data 
available data available in the site.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./images/srer_landing_page.png}
  \caption{SRER Landing Page\cite{hid505SrerWebSite2018}}\label{f:srer_landing_page}
\end{figure}


In figure~\ref{f:srer_precip_data_page} we have navigated one page deeper into 
the SRER site and as can be seen, meta-data and data are both availabe, but as 
raw text files.  These data are consumable as is, but could be enhanced by 
being made machine readible by creating web services to deliver the data.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./images/srer_precip_data_page.png}
  \caption{SRER Precipitation Data Page\cite{hid505SrerWebSite2018}}\label{f:srer_precip_data_page}
\end{figure}

\section{Data Loading}
The data sets downloaded for this demonstration were the raingage Universal 
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate data files and the Excel file that 
contained all of the preciption data for the respective raingages.  Some of 
the raingage data had to be cleaned mostly due to typographical errors and the 
UTM coordinates had to be converated to latitude and longitude values in case 
the data are rendered in mapping applications.

The precipitation data had to be converted from an Excel file to a CSV file 
and the value delimiter was changed from a comma to the pipe symbol.  The 
reason for this is because the comma can occur in some of the descriptive text 
data for raingages, where as the pipe symbol is typically not used in written 
English.

\section{Web API Development}
After the data were prepared for import into a database, the foundation for a 
simple web API application was established using the following software:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Docker - a container platform\cite{hid505Docker2018}
  \item Python - the programming language
  \item Graphene - a Python programming language library that is used to 
  develop GraphQL APIs
  \item PostgresQL - the database server
  \item Django - a Python based model-view-controller (MVC) web development 
  framework
  \item Django Rest Framework - a Django plugin that facilitates the 
  development of REST APIs
  \item Graphene Django - a Django plugin that facilitates development of 
  GraphQL APIs
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{REST/Swagger API}
Generally, a REST based API endpoints, in combination with a tool like Swagger 
are combined to create a web interface like the one shown in 
figure~\ref{f:rest_swagger_ui}.  The figure provides an example of the various 
API endpoints (e.g., /api/srer/v1.0/precipevents).  Some endpoints require 
input parameters which are used to execute parameterized queries (e.g., 
queries that filter data) data, while other endpoints require no parameters 
and typically return a list of data entities.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./images/rest_swagger_ui.png}
  \caption{REST/Swagger UI}\label{f:rest_swagger_ui}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{f:srer_rest_raingage_list} we see an example of a REST 
request's response and the resulting JSON data packet.  The JSON request is 
relatively clear.  Based on the request url in 
figure~\ref{f:srer_rest_raingage_list} we know the domain name (localhost), 
API context (srer), API version number (v1.0) and the data being requested 
(raingages).  However, in a REST API unless well documented by the developers, 
developing properly formated parameterized request urls can be challenging.  
However, the difficulties are counter-balanced by the implementing a Swagger 
UI for the API and making sure proper documentation is added, so the end-user 
has as much information as possible.

The JSON response is a bit more intuitive.  From firgure 
figure~\ref{f:srer_rest_raingage_list} we can see the basic data structure and 
data types.  There are many programming libraries that automate the parsing of 
JSON data into domain objects that facilitate API client development.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/srer_rest_raingage_list.png}
  \caption{REST/SWAGGER Response}\label{f:srer_rest_raingage_list}
\end{figure}

\subsection{GraphQL API}
Similar to the REST/Swagger user interface, many GraphQL APIs allow the 
developer to enable a user interface that serves as the GraphQL API's 
documentation.  Figure~\ref{f:graphql_ui} shows an example of the GraphQL API 
interface.  At first glance, the GraphQL interface appears to not have nearly 
the amount of documentation that the Swagger equivalent has.  However, the 
input portion (left half) of the interface has autocomplete features and the 
user simple has to hit the space bar or start typeing in order to get guidance 
from the interface.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/graphql_ui.png}
  \caption{GraphQL User Interface}\label{f:graphql_ui}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{f:graphql_rgs} demonstrates an example of a query in the GraphQL UI 
that is used to request a list of objects, in this case, all raingages.  The 
left half of the user interface is where the query is created.  The interface 
behaves similarly to many itegrated development environments (IDE) by being 
aware of the underlying data model and query request parameters.  Consequently, 
as the user is developing the query, the UI provides autocomplete features that 
help expedite query development.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/graphql_rgs.png}
  \caption{GraphQL UI Query Example}\label{f:graphql_rgs}
\end{figure}

The query results are JSON data packet that is a list of raingage objects 
including attributes for each raingage.  As with many other API's, this data 
packet can be consumed by a wide variety of clients including other web 
applications or thicker desktop clients like the statistical package R.

REST based API's are typically developed with create, retrieve, update and 
delete (CRUD) actions.  GraphQL APIs offer the same type of actions, but not in 
the same format.  Due to time constraints demonstration of those actions is 
outside of the scope of this paper.

\section{Service Comparison}
New tools like GraphQL have an appeal to developers because they are new tools 
and provided entertaining opportunities to learn something new.  However, it 
is important to validate the benefit of new tools by developing comparisons 
and measures against existing tools in order to assess qualitative attributes 
based on observed data and analysis.

Figures~\ref{f:comparison-table} 
and~\ref{f:comparison-graph}\cite{hid505Vzquez2017} demonstrate performance 
metrics and analysis based on their research.  Their results indicate that 
GraphQL may have better performance rates.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/network-response-times-table.png}
  \caption{GraphQL/REST Comparision}\label{f:comparison-table}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/network-response-times-graph.png}
  \caption{GraphQL/REST Comparision}\label{f:comparison-graph}
\end{figure}

In hopes of providing more effidence related to GraphQL performane in 
comparison to REST performance.  A simple load test was created to test 
the REST API developed for this project against the GraphQL API created also 
created for this project.

The test environment consisted of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item HP Spectre X360 Laptop with 16 GB of RAM
\item Intel i7 Processor
\item Ubuntu 16.04 Operating System
\item PostgreSql 9.5 Database Server
\item Python 3.6.4
\item Django 2.0.3
\item Locust Python load testing API and command line tool
\item Graphene and Dango-Grapql plugins were used to create the GraphQL API
\item Django Rest Framework was used to create the REST API
\end{enumerate}
The source code repository for this project provides more detail on APIs and 
Python libraries used to develop the interface.

The load test was simple in each case, simulate 100 users, spawning 5 users 
per second, for 10 minutes.  The Python load testing tool, Locust, was used 
to run each test under the described parameters and the web interface in 
Locust provided summy graphics showing the results of the test.

Figure~\ref{f:f:graphql_requests} and figure~\ref{f:graphql_response} 
demonstrate simple load tests run against the GraphQL API developed for this 
project.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/graphql_requests.png}
  \caption{GraphQL Total Requests per Second}\label{f:graphql_requests}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/graphql_response.png}
  \caption{GraphQL Average Response Time}\label{f:graphql_response}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{f:rest_requests} and figure~\ref{f:rest_response} show the results 
of the same test run against the REST API for the web application.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/rest_requests.png}
  \caption{REST Total Requests per Second}\label{f:rest_requests}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
  {./images/rest_response.png}
  \caption{REST Average Response Time}\label{f:rest_response}
\end{figure}

Contrary to expectations the test demonstrates that the response times for the 
REST web service are lower than for the equivalent GraphQL service.  However, 
given that the particular test is simplistic and there could be many other 
factors affecting the test, there is no evidence in this study to make qualitative 
statements about the performance of eith GraphQL or REST.  A more robust 
examination of the demo application and a rigorous load-testing design would 
be required in order to develop accurate insights into performance differences 
between the two technologies.

\section{Amazon Lambda}
If there is time describe and implement the Amazon Lambda that the web 
API/application can use.

\section{Raspberry Pi Cluster}
If there is time, describe and develop a three-node Raspberry Pi cluster and 
deploy the web api application to that cluser.

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion will go here.
